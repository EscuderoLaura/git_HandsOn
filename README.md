# git_HandsOn

#### *git_HandsOn* has been used as a training exercise from the MSc in Omics Data Analysis at UVIC-UCC to get familiar with the use of git and GitHub


**Branch Practical**
* #### Does branch was created to undertake a collaborative project with another student. In the end, the exercise was done in another repository, the information can be found in my repository git_HandsOn_collab.

**Scripts**
* #### The *seqClass.py* script allows to identify whether a sequence (-s) introduced by the user is DNA or RNA. It also identifies whether a specific motif (-m) introduced by the user is found within the sequence.

* #### The *seq_nt_proportion.py* script calculates the proportion of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA sequence (-s) introduced by the user. This script will be edited as a collaborative process with another student.
